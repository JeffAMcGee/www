Title: R2-D2
Category: Projects
Date: 2017-05-31


With some help from the [R2 Builders Club](https://astromech.net),
my wife and I built an R2-D2! He drives, makes sounds, and lights up, but there's still a lot to do.  For example, we haven't hooked up all the motors inside the dome and the motor to make the dome spin.

Here's our R2 with a few friends:

We also built a prototype out of K'NEX:
