Title: About Me
Date: 2013-04-26

Howdy! I'm the proudest member of the Texas Aggie class of '05.  Once upon a time, I taught High School.
I've done some other cool things including being an early employee at
[https://snoball.com/](Snoball).  I'm married to my favorite
Martian, @[http://twitter.com/KeriOnMars](KeriOnMars).
By the time you read this, I'll probably be finished with a masters degree at
Texas A&amp;M's [http://infolab.tamu.edu](Infolab).

My wife and I love to cook. We've been participating in Reddit's
[52 Weeks of Cooking](http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/).
I have a [gallery](http://52weeks.jeffamcgee.com/#/user/aggieastronaut) (built with Bootstrap and AngularJS) with
all of our entries to the competition.
