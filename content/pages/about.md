Title: About This Site
Date: 2013-04-26

Howdy! I'm the proudest member of the Texas Aggie class of '05! A-Whoop!
This is my blog.
It's mostly about technical stuff, but there might be something about cooking,
dancing, or bicycling hidden in here.

There are currently three types of posts on this site:

* [General](/category/general.html) - posts about anything
* [Tips](/category/tips.html) - short fixes to technical problems
* [Projects](/category/projects.html) - open source projects I've done (with a
  GitHub link)

I suppose I should add a little bit more about myself.
Once upon a time, I taught High School math, science, and computer science.
I loved teaching computer science, but teaching the other subjects wasn't as fun.
Also, public schools are a mess.
I've done some other cool things including being an early employee at
[Snoball](https://snoball.com/).  I'm married to my favorite
Martian, [@KeriOnMars](http://twitter.com/KeriOnMars).
I just finished up a masters degree at Texas A&amp;M's [Infolab](http://infolab.tamu.edu).
My master's thesis was on datamining Twitter to estimate the locations of users
on Twitter given the locations of their friends.
In other words, if you use Twitter, I know where you live.
That's probably why I don't use [my Twitter account](http://twitter.com/jeffamcgee) much.

My wife and I love to cook. We've been participating in Reddit's
[52 Weeks of Cooking](http://www.reddit.com/r/52weeksofcooking/).
I have a [gallery](http://52weeks.jeffamcgee.com/#/user/aggieastronaut) (built
with Bootstrap and AngularJS) with all of our entries to the challange.
