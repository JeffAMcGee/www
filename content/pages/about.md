About Me
--------
Howdy! I'm the proudest member of the Texas Aggie class of '05.  Once upon a time, I taught High School.
I've done some other cool things including being an early employee at
[https://snoball.com/](Snoball).  I'm married to my favorite
Martian, @[http://twitter.com/KeriOnMars](KeriOnMars).
By the time you read this, I'll probably be finished with a masters degree at
Texas A&amp;M's [http://infolab.tamu.edu](Infolab).

I really should put more here.
